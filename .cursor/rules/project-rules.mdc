# Project Rules

## Tech Stack
- This is a Tailwind CSS project
- Always use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Never write custom CSS unless absolutely necessary

## Tailwind Configuration
- **CRITICAL**: Always follow the Tailwind configuration defined in `tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.ts`
- Respect custom colors, spacing, fonts, and breakpoints defined in the config
- Use theme extensions and custom utilities as configured
- Reference the config file when unsure about available utility classes

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind's utility-first approach
- Compose complex styles using multiple utility classes
- Leverage Tailwind's responsive modifiers (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:)
- Use Tailwind's state modifiers (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.)
- Prefer Tailwind utilities over inline styles or custom CSS

## What to Avoid
- Don't use arbitrary values like `w-[123px]` if a standard utility exists
- Don't write custom CSS classes unless extending Tailwind in the config
- Don't use CSS-in-JS solutions that conflict with Tailwind
- Don't override Tailwind utilities with inline styles
